                    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating and designing
                        web pages. HTML consists of a series of tags that define the content and structure of a web
                        page. These tags are used to identify and organize different types of content, such as text,
                        images, links, forms, and multimedia.

                        HTML documents are structured as a hierarchy of elements, where each element is surrounded by
                        tags that describe its purpose and formatting. HTML also includes attributes that provide
                        additional information about an element, such as its color, size, or position on the page.

                        HTML is often used in combination with other web technologies, such as CSS (Cascading Style
                        Sheets) and JavaScript, to create more dynamic and interactive web pages. CSS is used to control
                        the visual style and layout of a web page, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity and
                        dynamic content.

                        HTML is a key component of web development and is supported by all major web browsers. As such,
                        it is an essential skill for anyone looking to create web pages or work in the field of web
                        development.</p>

                    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a web
                        page written in HTML or XML. CSS allows developers to separate the visual style and layout of a
                        web page from its content, making it easier to maintain and update.

                        CSS works by selecting elements in an HTML document and applying styles to them. These styles
                        can control a wide range of visual properties, such as color, size, font, spacing, and layout.
                        CSS styles can be applied to individual elements, groups of elements, or the entire page.

                        One of the key features of CSS is its ability to create responsive designs that adapt to
                        different screen sizes and devices. This is achieved through the use of media queries, which
                        allow developers to specify different styles for different devices and screen sizes.

                        CSS can be written inline within HTML documents, in a separate CSS file that is linked to the
                        HTML document, or in a style block within the HTML document. CSS can also be used in conjunction
                        with other web technologies, such as JavaScript, to create more dynamic and interactive web
                        pages.

                        CSS is an essential skill for anyone working in web development or web design, and is widely
                        supported by all major web browsers. By mastering CSS, developers can create visually appealing
                        and user-friendly web pages that are optimized for different devices and screen sizes.

                    <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that allows developers to collaborate on software projects and
                        share code with others. It is built on top of Git, a popular version control system that helps
                        developers track changes to their code over time.

                        GitHub provides a range of features for developers to manage and organize their code, including
                        the ability to create and fork repositories, make and review pull requests, manage issues and
                        bugs, and more. It also provides tools for collaboration, such as wikis, discussions, and
                        project management tools.

                    <h1 class="sub-title5">JavaScript</h1>
                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is widely used to add interactivity and dynamic
                        behavior to web pages. It is a high-level, interpreted language that can be run in web browsers,
                        on servers, and even on standalone devices.

                        JavaScript was first introduced in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular programming
                        languages in the world. It is used to create interactive user interfaces, web and mobile
                        applications, and server-side applications.

                        JavaScript has a simple and intuitive syntax that is similar to other programming languages,
                        such as C and Java. It supports object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming
                        paradigms, making it versatile and powerful.

                        Some of the key features of JavaScript include dynamic typing, first-class functions, and
                        closures. It also has built-in support for common data types, such as strings, numbers, and
                        arrays, as well as powerful features for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of web
                        pages.

                        JavaScript has a large and active community, with many libraries and frameworks available to
                        simplify common tasks and speed up development. Some popular frameworks include React, Angular,
                        and Vue.

                        Overall, JavaScript is an essential tool for modern web development and offers a wide range of
                        capabilities for building interactive and dynamic web applications
